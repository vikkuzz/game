This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Multiplayer Game Setup

This project includes a multiplayer game mode that requires a separate Socket.IO server. Vercel (serverless) doesn't support persistent WebSocket connections, so you need to deploy the Socket.IO server separately.

**For local development:** Just run `npm run dev` - everything works on one server.

**For production:** 
1. Deploy the Socket.IO server to Railway, Render, or Fly.io (see `DEPLOY_SOCKET_SERVER.md`)
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` environment variable in Vercel to your Socket.IO server URL

See `DEPLOY_SOCKET_SERVER.md` for detailed instructions.
